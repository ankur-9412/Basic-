        "\n",
        "Q1. What are the most common reasons for missing data in ETL pipelines?\n",
        "```\n",
        "The most common reasons for missing data in ETL pipelines are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Data entry errors – Users skip optional fields or enter incomplete forms.\n",
        "2. System integration issues – Data is lost during merging from multiple sources.\n",
        "3. Schema mismatch – Source and destination databases have different structures.\n",
        "4. Sensor or system failure – In IoT or automated systems, devices may fail to record data.\n",
        "5. Data corruption during transformation – Errors in transformation logic can remove values.\n",
        "6. Delayed data arrival – Some data may not be available at the time of extraction.\n",
        "```\n",
        "Q2. Why is blindly deleting rows with missing values considered a bad practice in ETL?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Blindly deleting rows with missing values is bad practice because:\n",
        "\n",
        "* It may remove a large amount of useful data.\n",
        "* It can introduce bias in the dataset.\n",
        "* It reduces sample size, affecting model accuracy.\n",
        "* Missing data may contain important patterns (e.g., high-income customers not disclosing salary).\n",
        "Therefore, missing data should be analyzed before removal.\n",
        "```\n",
        "Q3. Difference between Listwise Deletion and Column Deletion\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "1. Listwise Deletion\n",
        " > Removes entire rows where any value is missing.\n",
        " > Used when missing data is very small (e.g., less than 5%).\n",
        " > Appropriate scenario: When analyzing survey data where only a few respondents skipped one question.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Column Deletion\n",
        " > Removes an entire column (feature) if it contains too many missing values.\n",
        " > Used when the column is mostly empty and not important.\n",
        " > Appropriate scenario: A “Middle Name” column missing for 90% of customers.\n",
        "```\n",
        "Q4. Why is median imputation preferred over mean imputation for skewed data such as income?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Median is preferred because:\n",
        "\n",
        " > Income data is usually right-skewed (few very high values).\n",
        " > Mean is affected by extreme outliers.\n",
        " > Median represents the middle value and is more robust.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "If incomes are ₹20k, ₹25k, ₹30k, ₹35k, ₹5,00,000\n",
        "Mean becomes very high due to ₹5,00,000, but median remains stable.\n",
        "```\n",
        "Q5. What is forward fill and in what type of dataset is it most useful?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Forward fill is a method where missing values are replaced with the last known previous value.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is most useful in:\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Time-series datasets\n",
        "  > Stock prices\n",
        "  > Sensor readings\n",
        "  > Daily sales reports\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "If Monday = 100, Tuesday = missing → Tuesday becomes 100.\n",
        "```\n",
        "Q6. Why should flagging missing values be done before imputation in an ETL workflow?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Flagging missing values:\n",
        "\n",
        " > Preserves information that data was originally missing.\n",
        " > Helps machine learning models detect patterns in missingness.\n",
        " > Prevents loss of important business signals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Customers who don’t provide income might belong to a specific risk group.\n",
        "```\n",
        "Q7. Consider a scenario where income is missing for many customers.\n",
        " How can this missingness itself provide business insights?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "Missing income itself can reveal patterns such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. High-income individuals may avoid sharing salary.\n",
        "2. Low-income customers may skip income due to hesitation.\n",
        "3. Certain regions or customer segments may have higher missing rates.\n",
        "4.It may indicate privacy concerns or trust issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "Business Insight:\n",
        "The company can:\n",
        "\n",
        " > Adjust marketing strategy.\n",
        " > Improve form design.\n",
        " > Identify high-risk or high-value customer segments.\n",
        "```\n",
