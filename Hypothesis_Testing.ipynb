        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "A null hypothesis (H₀) is a statement that assumes no effect, no difference, or no relationship exists between variables in a population. It represents the default or initial assumption that any observed difference in a sample is due to random chance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why the Null Hypothesis is Important:\n",
        "\n",
        " * Provides a baseline – It gives a reference point against which the alternative hypothesis is tested.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Enables statistical testing – Most statistical tests are designed to assess whether there is enough evidence to reject H₀.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Controls decision-making – By assuming no effect initially, it reduces bias and helps avoid false conclusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Supports objective conclusions – Decisions are based on probability (p-value) rather than assumptions or opinions.\n",
        "```\n",
        "#  2: What does the significance level (α) represent in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "The significance level (α) represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis (H₀) when it is actually true. In simple terms, it is the risk of making a Type I error.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Points about Significance Level (α)\n",
        " * Measures tolerance for error – It defines how much risk a researcher is willing to accept for a false positive result.\n",
        " * Decision rule – If the p-value ≤ α, the null hypothesis is rejected; if p-value > α, the null hypothesis is not rejected.\n",
        " * Common values – Typical choices for α are 0.05 (5%), 0.01 (1%), and 0.10 (10%).\n",
        " * Set before testing – α is chosen before conducting the hypothesis test to ensure objectivity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "If α = 0.05, it means there is a 5% chance of concluding that a result is statistically significant when it is actually due to random chance.\n",
