        "```\n",
        "A Common Table Expression (CTE) is a temporary named result set in SQL that exists only for the duration of a single query. It is defined using the WITH keyword and can be referenced like a table in the main query.\n",

        "How CTE Improves SQL Query Readability\n",
        " 1. Makes queries easier to understand\n",
        "    CTEs replace complex subqueries with meaningful names, making the logic clear.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Improves structure and organization\n",
